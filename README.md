This repository stores the code and the data for the paper titled _Color-Emotion Associations in a Low-Dimensional Conceptual Space_. 

The data folder holds the pre-processed matrices from the behavioral experiments. It also has the behavioral data in .csv format with more information if someone wants to take a look at it. 

The code folder provides jupyter-notebooks for reproducing the figures in the paper. Each notebook generates one figure.
